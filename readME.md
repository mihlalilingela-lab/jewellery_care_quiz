So I created this mini project to hammer in the following concepts: 
•	User Input →ie input("How often do you wear jewelry? ")
•	Type Conversion → ie int(input("Enter your budget: "))
•	Conditional Execution (if / elif / else) → decision trees for answers.
•	Comparison Operators → ie if budget > 500:
•	Multi-way Decisions → elif chains for more than 2 outcomes.
•	Try / Except → handle invalid input gracefully.
•	Loops & Iterations
o	Definite (for) → ask a set of questions, loop through them.
o	Indefinite (while) → keep running until user enters “quit.”
•	"Largest so far" Value → ie track the priciest item or worst jewelry-care habit chosen.
•	Summing / Average → total up scores or budgets.
•	Boolean / None → search for a certain answer, return True/False or None if not found.
•	Functions → put sections of the quiz into functions for readability

Now it's important to note that not all these concepts were used in the implementation of this part quiz, such functions or largest so far. However, it is knowledge I will use and build upon the more I do small mini projects. I'm taking my time as this is a whole new concept for me and I don't want to rush it. 
I definetely used AI as a "teacher" or "guide" of sorts, or to grade my code as well as to question my logic without giving me the answers ion some cases.
I used Claude for this.
I used ChatGPT for project ideas.
The insights from the google forms link will be recorded and this information will be used to build upon this project eg. collecting insights, mapping data, ML for predictive models in future
You are most welcome to run this locally, the code is avalable.
Python 3 to be installed.
Phoenix Code editor (opt)
Set up your path properly
Download the py and txt file
Run via command line

This is a small project to showcase progress and skill. That's all. I figure the fastest way to learn would be publically and that will hold me accountable.
